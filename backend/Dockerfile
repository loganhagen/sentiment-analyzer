# Docker has excellent documentation which can be found at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
# The documentation below was inspired from the official docker docs

# A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM clause. There are pre-built images in the Docker Hub registry. 
# Since we are building a Node application we are pulling the node image from docker hub 
# We use alpine as it is lightweight and our backend only needs to run python
FROM python:3.10.10-slim

# The ARG stanza defines a variable that users can pass at build-time
ARG PORT=8080

# ENV works very similar to ARG. They are use to set environment variables inside the image
# Difference is ENV is always persisted in the built image but ARG is not
# In the ENV command below, we are saving the environment variable PORT with the value 8080
# We could have set the ENV directly to 8080 but sometimes ARGS are helpful when we need to use the VARIABLES set by ARG elsewhere
ENV PORT $PORT

# The RUN stanza runs the commands mentioned while building the image

# WORKDIR creates the directory and changes the current working directory to the created directory
WORKDIR /app/backend
COPY . /app/backend


RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install cron
RUN chmod 0644 runCron
RUN crontab runCron

# Install and update all python libraries required to run the backend
RUN pip --no-cache-dir install -r requirements.txt



# Last we expose the PORT 8080.
# The EXPOSE STANZA informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
EXPOSE $PORT

# CMD runs when you want to run a container from an image. This can be overridden in the docker compose file
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
# 
CMD cron
