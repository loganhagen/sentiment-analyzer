3. Click on "Open folder in Container" from the dropdown menu
4. Select the "backend" folder from the project's root directory

### Updating The Container

When making any changes to the backend files, make sure to update all containers from within the three container stack folder using:
-  `$ docker compose up --force-recreate --build -d`
