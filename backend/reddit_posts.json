This seems to always be the line of any power elite when any social program is mentioned, be it stimulus, UBI, and was even the argument when we created social security, welfare, child labor laws, and made collective bargaining legal, and gave the vote to women, and freed the slaves. \u201cIt will hurt those you\u2019re trying to help.\u201d That\u2019s the refrain of the power elite. \n\nI see why you\u2019d ask the question in the OP but to me it\u2019s rearranging deck chairs on the titanic to even talk about. AI is replacing labor en masse and there will be enormous production increases, we will have a need for very radical redistribution policies and have to rewrite all the economics books from scratch. There will no longer be any particular \u201cmarket\u201d need for a large population. This leads to moral issues and cultural values and has much less to do with economics. \n\nI think we should skip past the economics discussion and go straight to the moral objections that will arise in a world where paid work isn\u2019t really necessary for most people.\n\nIt\u2019s rarely admitted, but a lot of people, and certainly a lot of power elites, may think, in this scenario, that 8 billion human lives are not necessary and a net negative. They value a human life by its \u201cuse value.\u201d Not its inherent value. This is never talked about. But it\u2019s the ONLY topic worth talking about."

That's not a UBI.\n\nAdditionally, the actual study makes sure to mention that the employment reduction was almost entirely observed among parents with young kids who were obviously choosing to do care work at home instead of paying others for care work. People didn't work less. They just chose to work at home without pay.\n\nThis experiment also tested a phaseout rate of 25%-35% where the phaseout was 25% below an income line and 35% over that income line, to compare to the 100% phaseout rate. This cohort is comparable to a UBI paired with a 25%-35% tax on earned income above the UBI. That group showed a much smaller reduction of parents of small kids reducing their employment.\n\nThe 100% phaseout showed a 9.5 percentage point reduction. The 25%-35% phaseout showed a 3.5 percentage point reduction. This is clearly evidence in support of UBI instead of typical welfare with its massive marginal tax rates and sheer welfare cliffs."

Here in the US, we saw asset prices soar and wages stagnate as Quantitative Easing stimulated the economy from the top down.  Pandemic stimulus led to consumer price inflation because it had a significant component of direct payments to individuals.  Neither of these policies were paid for by taxation."

The article is full of good reasons for the recipients and society at large to adopt UBI (the same logic can be used in support of similar social security measures). I applaud their intentions.\n\nIt doesn't however consider how the few people who possess 95% of the world's wealth might be persuaded to share (or even just pay taxes). I know this kind of topic isn't in their wheelhouse and isn't the kind of thing their readers are interested in, but anything less is just basking in fantasy.\n\nKeep in mind that UBI is \\_the\\_ essential lifeline we're all banking on because we're staring down the barrel of mass automation, making all sorts of human sources of income obsolete.\n\nIt may happen even sooner than the most cravenly optimistic technologists had predicted. A very lengthy paper just released suggests that we're already beginning to see glimpses of Artificial General Intelligence.\n\nThis video summarises it in a bite-sized 13 minutes [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqg3aTGNxZ0)"

There are links to the story from that Wikipedia page. It's basically a science fiction story built around the idea of stupid people over-populating the earth, smart (not rich and elite) people not being able to keep things going, and someone displaced from our century showing them how to fix their problem.\n\nAs for the substack article, it has obvious logical flaws. First, it presents the author as somebody who believes he and his class got where they are by dint of their superior genes. Most of them may -- may probably -- believe that about themselves, but they move in those circles. They know that for every superior person who gets rich there are a number who get just as rich, or richer, because of nepotism, cronyism, luck, fraud, etc. Most of today's titled elites are simply the descendants of the most ruthless, violent SOBs alive when the aristocratic class figured out how to make the then-current group of ruling families the final group of ruling families. And the poor out-bred the rich back then. Dirt-poor farmers had tons of kids for the free labor and because they didn't expect them all to reach adulthood.\n\nThe idea that the rich will produce lesser offspring is commonly understood it's a cliche. They might present such arguments, but if they were smart, they'd know a lot of people would see their premise is weak. The author would also know that no level of UBI is going to tempt a true gold digger away from the rich. In fact, the stability of UBI might increase the number of gold diggers because they wouldn't have to marry a \"lesser\" person to stay alive. Nor would they have to work, which would take time away from their preparations and hunt for a rich partner. Or they could put more money toward plastic surgery, etc. He would not fret about finding a beautiful gold digger to procreate with, and if he did he'd just add a line about \"the most beautiful among you will be kept around for breeding purposes, obviously.\" \n\nSo, it's well written, but I think the arguments are so obviously wrong the average reader would spot the attempt at satire. If they didn't, they would probably think, \"this is not a guy we have to worry about.\""

Makes it easier for everyone to make more money and afford any taxes.  UBI still empowers lower paid workers to get fair pay and work conditions without the structural threat of starvation or homelessness.  But we can't make work a terrible deal after taxes, travel expenses, restaurant lunches, etc...\n\nGMI is basically just welfare expansion to everyone without application process: Just tax refunds paid monthly.  The broken system of welfare and UI is that it pays people to not work.  UBI lets you work/do anything instead of forcing you, rationally, to avoid paid work."

When humans use Stable Diffusion to make art, they are curating its results, which creates a new dataset. Even if you have to start at Alphonse Mucha from the 1890s, you can still eventually create a model that does modern anime images via repeated iterations, curation, and retraining. You delay things two years at most, and the class action suit probably won't be finished for five.\n\nLet's be honest about copyright too. It has generally only ever served big money. The copyright alliance siding with the plaintiffs is the same set of people that wanted SOPA to pass.\n\nThe core of this problem is automation, not art theft. Whichever way this lawsuit goes I think in the grander picture the debate is good and necessary. Automation is accelerating at a rate that we need to be sounding the alarms about. Without any serious new safety net policies such as basic income, this is going to be a disaster."

It'll be a tool to devalue self expression and ultimately crush creativity.  The creative journey is as important as the end result itself.

I don't see it because for that to be true, GPT-4 should be able to generate income, but GPT-4 is a technology, cannot be tax it. If a country tax it and other don't, people will take the services from the cheapest vendors, e.g. those that are in countries that don't have a tax in technology.

The dichotomy between \"capitalism\" and socialism\" and \"markets\" and \"state\" and \"individualism\" and \"collectivism\" needs to come to an end. We talk so much about these ideologies, and we often have people speak extremely dogmatically. The right claims all government action is bad and all market action is good, and then you got the far left doing the opposite.\n\nI tend to lean closer to how these global south people think in this paper, about how UBI is liberating from coercive economic forces, without creating new coercive economic forces via state action. I don't want \"socialism\" and the government running everything and workers owning the means of production and blah blah blah. I also dont want a neoliberal capitalist hellscape. I think UBI is a sane policy that tends to capture the best aspects of both approaches, and should be central to a 21st century \"new new deal\". Not saying we cant have other programs too, the article itself stated it works best when paired with some other state programs like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. I generally agree with that and support supplementing UBI with programs like universal healthcare, free college, some sort of housing program, etc. \n\nSadly, the only \"new deal\" we see proposed comes from the left with the so called \"green new deal\" which leans way too hard into job guarantees and creating work for the sake of giving people an income. Even if we need a \"green\" program too for the 21st century...something more moderate like build back better or yang's 2020 plan might be better than some massive green new deal. Again, these guys are trying to channel FDR a little too literally here.\n\nThe left is also unfairly critical of UBI, mostly due to ideology, going on about how UBI is a trojan horse and markets are bad and blah blah blah. Most of their arguments are more ideological posturing than anything based in reality. And it kinda pisses me off and alienates me, as someone who typically leans left but has a different brand of left wing politics than traditional leftism. \n\nThat said I like this article."

It should come as no surprise that young people are skipping the very expensive process of sorting themselves for the benefit of employers.  Colleges have only themselves to blame in having promised more than they could deliver.  It is unfortunate that education itself has come to resemble the lottery tickets sold by many state governments to fund it.  When we have a real safety net such as a basic income guarantee, perhaps the shift in the balance of power in the labor market will be permanent, and people will not waste their time and limited resources on unnecessary performances."

If not enough taxes are collected, then you may get inflation, which is a another way of tax collection. Also, it implies an increase in the demand for the products basics. These are already produced at the lower cost with mass production (e.g. grain, rice, etc). Therefore, inflation don't have that big impact (as the cheaper competitors take the most of the market share). The exception is housing, as housing cannot be truly liberalized. However, it seems more realistic when UBI is implemented at scale, as countryside accomodation demand is quite low. Hence, at scale (e.g. country level), it is possible to find cheaper accomodation (e.g. countryside).\n\nWith UBI, you are giving people outside of the system a way to participate, hence activating economic activity. This has been recommended already by Milton Friedman (on of the main references for liberal capitalism) as Negative Income Tax. The alternative is to hope for governments to invest in public spending with an excess in the labour market which raises the standards of work. I am personally feel more comfortable with UBI/NIT.\n\nMy personal opinion is that in most of western countries, 500 GBP should be enough. The primary goal with UBI is to allow people to reach financial independence, so they can quit a job or a toxic relationship. 500 GBP don't give you for a lot in any major city, but it is enough in smaller cities and the countryside."

Doctors and lawyers typically don\u2019t need their loans paid back as they typically made significant amounts of money, mid career on (of which I am not part of those professions). People that go to school and can\u2019t find a way to apply their degree to the real world that can benefit one self for a living wage, deserve to pay back their loans for the horrible decisions made. You don\u2019t have to go to college if you don\u2019t chose to. You also don\u2019t have to spend 4 years studying something irrelevant for 50k+ in loans if you don\u2019t want to.

Making Bachelor's degrees worth something in society. Especially liberal and fine arts degrees. Basically we need to expand permanent and accessible research opportunities for graduates in connection with basic income as a \"floor\" for guaranteed income and jobs.\"\n\nIt's been pretty foolish to train students to assume loads of debt for the chance to compete for jobs that you may or may not get, meaning you may or may not be able to pay off your school debt. Of course if students do land so-so paying jobs, many are indebted for years paying off student loans. There's not even appreciation. It's a real horrible lesson in personal finance strategies. \n\nSpeaking of personal finance, here's an interesting [report](https://www.gobankingrates.com/making-money/economy/rising-cost-of-living-in-america/) from aggregate data regarding rise in cost of living expenses.

Angela Eagle (the challenger) is more to the right of the party (but still very left compared to say, US politics), and is likely to be less keen. That said, it's a possibility.\n\nAll in all I think this is a very positive step for it becoming part of the political mainstream and into the national debate."

You can't because they're true. I'm citing multiple articles all saying the same thing and all I get back is \"no it's not true you're bullshitting\". It's pathetic.

Obviously not the meaning of the quote but it mildly relates to UBI (and just where we're already headed) in that there's a need to give people a better baseline with more options - and one of the main ways to implement that is through expansion of automation/robotics (at least in competitive/capitalist markets).\n\nSo drawing from that, I suppose I'd ask how can we prevent the market from constricting the ability for work if there will be a cost-benefit to making everything automated (simultaneously decentivizing labor work to a point where it's not a even a fraction of the market)? That quote also touches on something more personal for me and that's our frame of judgement on \"talent\" and value.\n\nI know I'm kinda grasping at straws here since the quote is talking about slave labor and not just legitimate labor.. But we do tend to associate labor with the extreme negative *more* than the positive.. So if we don't *currently* give a whole lot of value to the working class or the value of the work - unless we make clear the intention to maintain a passionate labor force - what would prevent a complete disappearance of labor workers/small businesses/ind. contractors *and/or* the complete control by corporations? \n\n(I suppose in this hypothetical future, there's always a chance - if resources don't grow too sparse - that BIEN *could* be a factor in giving people *more* of a chance to do self-fulfilling labor work at home/in the community instead of doing it for some arbitrary, uncared-for [potentially evil] entity. Just as long as we keep an eye out for the farmers and ranchers.. I'm happy :)"

That's because if you're crazy, nobody's going to hire you, and working does in a sense build character and force you to integrate with other people (eg. similar to what school does to kids). \n\nFor example: imagine if we had a growing group of Islamic extremists who wanted to impose Sharia Law and violently attack dissidents. Or say a growing group of neo-Nazis or just plain crazy people. Under a basic income, we're not only funding these peoples' lives, but enabling these societies to flourish in a way that would probably be more difficult under a system where people have to work and integrate with society.\n\nWe're actually starting to see something like this already in Europe ([No-Go Zones in Sweden](https://youtu.be/42jpuXJPk0w)). I'd imagine that BI would only enable these socially detrimental communities to further grow and be further removed from society because there's no need to even attempt to integrate.\n\nOf course I believe that overall the benefits of BI far outweigh the negatives, but this is the one negative that I believe needs serious consideration."

You know the ones. As part of the scheme to turn one set of workers against another by granting them a teensy-weensy bit of status the others don't get, the notion of being \"hard-working\" has been attributed to that more favored group as its differentiator. To distinguish that group by a means other than the superficial, being willing to work is the supposed character trait that sets them above the rest. It's this group, along with the very wealthy whose status also depends upon maintaining this fiction, who will likely fight UBI the strongest.\n"

I have put every cent I have for the last 3 years to get this product/company off the ground with very little success. When it was just an idea I sought out multiple companies to help prototype, but the fees were absolutely outrages and unaffordable, so I had to do it myself. Then comes the patents after my first few visits to patent lawyers I soon realized there was no way I could drum up 30,000. So I had to spend a year learning how to do my own patents. Then I wanted to have them manufactured.... lol forget it! The only way to get cost down would be to purchase at minimum hundreds of thousands of dollars. So I had to go back and redesign one that I could build myself in my garage and yet still looked like a product. Now, years later, I have finally finished. Ive sold 4 so far with 7 more waiting, but I have to build them one at a time in the evening after working 60 hr work weeks. No bank will loan any type of money. Had I of known it was going to be this hard I doubt I would have tried. There is absolutely no help from anywhere. Nonetheless here we go, one at a time, my only hope is that the product will spread by word of mouth and I can begin to sell enough to quit my day job. One thing is for sure, as I grow, it will remain people that build them and not machines, I hope I can offer to people thousands of jobs as I believe everyone needs at least one.  "

But institutionally speaking, that is exactly the state of things: that we are not allowed to so much as *be* without first securing permission from our \"betters\".\n\nFood? Water? Clothing? Shelter? Medical care? All these are secondary, and come with a labor component that must be compensated, one way or another. But the simple right to be?

Of course conservatives would fight this tooth and nail but his ideas for taxing companies for replacing workers with automation and taxing companies for robot workers and ai systems that displace employees and making companies more accountable for displacing human resources for tech solutions, or ideas like charging companies that outsource their labor american payroll taxes on those foreign workers are ideas that are somewhat more palatable to people who find any tax increase difficult to swallow. Plus everyone would benefit from yangs ubi plan yes everyone would indeed be paying more in taxes, but supposedly no individual would be paying more than the net yearly 12k benefit. At least on paper i guess well never know how yangs plan would play out in real life now but if anything he got the idea out into the minds of the public and policymakers. Im still kinda sour over him dropping out of the running tho he had a lot of other really good ideas for policy and actually had been endorsed by jack the twitter ceo and elon musk and a few other people. Its kinda hard to argue against his policies when economists and some of the worlds most successful and wealthy people back him."

But it\u2019s very easy for the Pope to say when despite being one of the worlds wealthiest organisations, his church doesn\u2019t have to foot the bill. I can guarantee he\u2019d think differently if we proposed taxing the profits of churches to help pay for it.\n\nEdit: People seem to be misinterpreting my intentions. Like I said in a couple of comments below, I have nothing against this Pope or most Catholic followers.\n\n- I\u2019m not suggesting that the Catholic Church is currently a totally corrupt, money-hoarding machine, or that the Pope is an arsehole. The current Pope seems relatively progressive for a Pope, and seems to have the desire to steer his church in the right direction.\n\n- It\u2019s not untrue that the Catholic Church is vastly wealthy. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not also extremely charitable.\n\n- It\u2019s also not untrue that they will not be contributing to a government-funded UBI.\n\n- Churches absolutely can, should, and do make profits. What they\u2019re supposed to do is [use those profits to fund the goals of their organisation](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-charities/start-charity/not-profit). I\u2019m not suggesting we tax those profits. I\u2019m suggesting that if we did, or if we imposed other taxes on certain activities or expenses of churches, in order to help fund a UBI, they would perhaps not be so supportive of it.\n\nEdit 2: I somehow typed Pope as Poo in my edit."

I craft collision art with verbal and nonverbal narration, gameplay, musical interlude, and storytelling, occasionally my commentary such as this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It occurred to me that the solution Alan Watts cites from the likes of Theobald and Buckminster Fuller can be stated in a clear and profound sentence.\n* We must stop funding work only from the labor/production edge, and instead fund it at the bottom, where the purchase takes place - resulting in synergy , emergence , economics which are in fact democratic because no one is being coerced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Poverty Game\n\n*Introduction*\n\n: : : : :\n\nI recently realized that there is in fact some more things to be said in the stead of Alan Watts\n\nbecause he was wrong about something.\n\nIf you listen to the end of the web of life - I added this segment to the sum up in the 2nd zen show - he\u2019s talking about what\u2019s left to do after we feed everyone and eliminate poverty completely with our automation and machinery. What he\u2019s talking about is living for celebration, for joy, for meditation within all actions that aren\u2019t done In order to get something.\n\nSo he was wrong, he spoke of the great depression, and made an assumption that the path ahead was a sure progression to a social organism that only might fall because of nuclear suicide.\n\nHe didn\u2019t see that cancer, bad rapidity, a wealth tumor paradigm, would be the mortality threat impending.\n\n*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022What happened to modern society because the great miracle of modern science turned cancerous ?*\n\n: : : : :\n\nthis is the prob right now : humans need money,\n\nwe have what can be thought of as the inverse of a moneyless society.\n\nit absolutely requires monetary input \u2014 it does not permit the existence of the outsiders to this - if there is a single way of defining the outsider it does not permit, it is the money transact.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n*(You must play)*\n\n*Or*\n\n*You Must Pay*\n\n: : : : :\n\nThe best way to upset the officials around here is to go along about your business rent free, tax free, and income free.\n\nAs an independent contractor my finances are written to reflect that I operate at a loss. The revenue does not exceed the costs to operate. As an educator you can see that my expense + actions generate gains which are non monetary. I convert the money into real wealth, in the act of teaching Sovereignty and Third place with the core value being =We, school, government, church, or anyone else do not tell you who you are, you tell us that. -\n\nOddly, there\u2019s a whole array of partial systems if you float in that space of almost no income. The best of which is, funding that you can only spend on feeding you / family dependents. It\u2019s a weird tool because almost the only way to benefit from it is to rig your finance numbers so they\u2019ll give it you. The actual math situation is so far from what the system is asking for for input, it\u2019s sort of funny.\n\nThis system actually makes a recognition of the necessity to put funds into human wellness as a decentralized minimum transaction, such as the public school concept absolutely does not.\n\n*\u2022\u2022\u2022No shirt, no shoes, no sovereignty*\n\n: : : : :\n\nSo let\u2019s study the big math about this. Alan Watts said the inner meaning of tech was to give your workers less work to do and let you go gaze at the moon and make love instead of wasting away in the office.\n\nLet me paint the predicament that goes on around here because that meaning was placed in a box labeled \u201cSocialism - Do Not Use\u201d\n\n* There is an insane level of Debt, theoretical funds, which will never ever be payable or become funded, those holding the debts will never collect, never convert to Real wealths.\n\nSuspended thefts\n\n* At the same time there is production which can never be purchased - Real goods which only have theoretical value whilst outside the circulation of purchase. unrented office, vehicle, home, and unsold tradeables - commodities.\n\nExpired food they can\u2019t sell because - they made too much and didn\u2019t create moneys to come back to themselves in exchange for the nutrition. An arcade that you can\u2019t get tokens to play in\n\nThe Profit accumulated by our so called innovators are almost totally False gains when there is so much idle production. this is suspended wealth.\n\nthis is a mathematical double bind in the heart attack of Ultra Classism.\n\npretend funds which will never Actualize\n\nIdle wealth which will never convert back to the funds value for any participants thereof - effectively disconnecting the final value of the sum of owners/craft inventors and workers effort into design and production: suspend it within the theoretical, an inverse to the non-actualized funds-owed oF debts\n\nUnpurchasable goods\n\nNow it starts to become more clear that what\u2019s going on is ecological malfunction .\n\n*division by zero*\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n: : : : :\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t work for free\u201d\n\nYes you do. Everyone does,\n\nWhy- because the agreed upon value of every given thing has been suspended within the theoretical realm and held up as Net Worth, as debt, and so forth.\n\nThe gdp of the economy no longer has a meaning, it\u2019s an artificial , counterfeit Floor Model with the real wealth being kept on an island like the gold originally was before being lost in a seismic event. Suspended in false gains and unpurchasable overstock, these are the tumors which have grown, an ever increasing rot where should be the basic flow of what the cells and organs of the organism Lives off of.\n\n*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022whaT we need is JUICE*\n\n: : : : :\n\nTherefore\n\nWhat are we working for anymore ?\n\nAll activities have been value juiced - There is no fucking juice left.\n\nThe only juice there is is\n\nactually something else,\n\nit\u2019s what\u2019s missing from all this.\n\nWhat defines the Does Not Have in false gains and the horrible plastic substitute for a Wage , where the only thing missing is the Made In China inscription.\n\nSharing.\n\nSharing is the only juice left.\n\nThe transaction of pure value transfer."

However, I DO believe that Basic Income has the potential to make the Green Party politically viable. That's because automation is on track to raise the US employment rate to 50% by 2040-2050. Basic income will be about the only viable solution to this problem. If the Green Party is out front and loud about this issue before the Dems and Repubs see the writing on the wall and try to co-opt it, the Greens might just make some headway in US politics."

And second, the mistaken idea that wages and profits are antithetical to each other, and therefore that a lack of jobs is due to capital investors constraining the supply of jobs and that low wages are due to capital investors taking the value of workers' labor in the form of profit.

What's the connection to future productivity?  A conclusion that a lot of politicians, economists, and even social commentators *still* don't seem to get is that maximizing a workforce's potential total cognitive capacity will be increasingly important in modern **knowledge-based economies** wherein *physical tasks* are being automated leaving increasingly only more and more *cognitive ones*.  \n\nThe entire structure of work is changing.^1  Cognitive capacity is going to be the new limiting factor of production.  And countries that can identify that better than other ones and respond to it are going to out-compete the ones that don't.  \n\n------\n1 \n\nAs tasks shift from \"physical\" to \"cognitive\" (by the way, there isn't a hard distinction between the two, but that's another discussion) the nature of work will change in a number of ways that will necessitate universal basic income.  Here are three of them: extended education, precarious contract employment, and the impossibility of incentivizing the most radical innovation using (and by definition, *within*) the current knowledge that exists and the status quo, the \"rules of operation\" (be they economic, political, technological, or other) built on that knowledge.  \n\n-\n\nExtended Education:  As higher and higher cognitive requirements become necessary for employment, longer and longer periods of \"non-productive\" education will be required before young workers join the workforce for the first time.  You know how \"Bachelor's degrees are the new high school diploma\" or heard the term \"degree inflation\"? And Master's degrees are pretty much already the new Bachelor's.  \n\nDuring this period of education, students require income support to function.  And they aren't going to be able to complete these degrees/paths of learning that take longer and longer periods of time before employment, unless it's there.  That's why when Ph.D. programs began developing, they *had* to provide paychecks to their researchers.  Because what we now call grad students had reached an age at which they could no longer be expected not to \"work\" (in the traditional, agriculture, manufacturing or service sense).  The increasing intellectual requirements of the information age are going to continually push the age at which one is expected to \"leave\" (well, for the major/first time) education and join the workforce past what has become the standard for this limit.  If we don't culturally update this limit and implement more long term or more universal income support, some of our most promising, potentially productive future students will be left with half-completed knowledge and drop out of the educational system (people already drop out of PhD programs because they're too long/too difficult/too much sacrifice, etc.), wasting a significant amount of everyone's resources (society's, and the individuals').  Also, as the pace of technological development increases, there will be increasing creative destruction of professions in the labor market.  This will increasingly make \"re-training\" periods between jobs (and even professions) during which workers return to education (and leave the \"productive\" labor force) more common, and the increasing technological complexity will make such training periods longer.  \n\n-\n\nPrecarious Contract Employment:  As the labor force gets increasingly marginalized (wait for it, it's a pun) and the pace of technological development increases, there will be increasing creative destruction of professions in the labor market.  Development of marginal employee time use (there it is) and employment parameter technologies will increase as well.  You'll see things like more elaborate quota monitoring, microtasking services (and employment for those providing the microtasking), algorithmic work scheduling for shift workers that optimize company profits (not worker health/stability/utility, and, in fact, externalize the negative costs of such scheduling systems to the worker).  These will all cause more people to have more unpredictable income in the future, which can lead to potentially detrimental economic outcomes (depends on the situation, but yeah), like extremely high savings rate (because you're more conservative with your spending when you don't know where your next paycheck is coming from), lowered velocity of money, low growth rate, etc. (does that set of circumstances sound familiar?  See Piketty's \u03b2 = s/g).  \n\n-\n\nThe Impossibility of Incentivizing the most Radical Innovation using the rules of Operation built on Existing Knowledge to try to Appropriately Reward Innovation: It is impossible to correctly incentivize innovation.  Attempts to put a metric to it are very often shortsighted and ineffective.  This is why the mantra of all the top tech companies and academic institutions that are trying to get real innovation out of their workers has always been reduced to \"hire people who are smart (have perhaps good potential to do this thing we want, but we don't really know for sure), give them resources, and get out of their way\" (well... at least marginally more than other businesses and academic institutions).  There is no way to put an effective metric on innovation *using knowledge that currently exists*, because innovation, *by definition*, is discovery that *transcends what the current best understanding is*.  Attempts to put a metric to innovations in terms of \"deliverables\" usually result in small, short-sighted projects and products (-and people!  They produce outsize rewards for a very specific, limited type of human thought) that might be fancy, flashy, superficially intriguing, etc., but ultimately are not game changers.  \n"

I am weird in that i have looked for ways to live and continue to create on absurdly low income, I know i am a rare bird. =) though...most people would not even consider...how can i get my expenses so minimal that i can live on a few hundred a month, being willing to live in substandard living situations, live very raw just so i can pursue my calling as an artist\n\n..and deal somehow with instability of not just housing but studio space, always having to move and cant make it break even to be a creative person. i keep at ity because i am extremely strong willed and determined, but like my whole life its been...everyone i know saying you will starve you will be poor, its impossible...you know...its like you'll shoot your eye out and constantly from everyone in society...if you dare to be like no - whatever comes -  i am doing this ! thats how it is now...and maybe once there were grants and fed funding...whats left of federal funding for actual artists is now food stamps and crazy pay under SSI or some other weird thing. well i cannot afford false shame or the luxury of false pride, but still...this is kinda ridiculous.\n\ndo we want to live in a society without art? without inspiration or soul food or anything beyond being workers and consumers? the way it is now is only the very very lucky and extremely well connected to even eek out a barely sustainable income in the arts...and you have to be willing to totally tune out all the people telling you that youre signing up to starve just to fulfill your calling?\n\nbut there is more than just artists, too, i mean creativity should just be a part of everyones life i think, everyone has their way of being creative and people need to be supported in that. maybe they just want to dabble and learn the cello, make some simple crafts etc...there should be space in society for everyone to have the leisure to explore that. but not just art specifically...i want everyone to be able to find their calling and be able to explore it...i mean maybe its bio chemistry, or science or whatever else...but those people who could be making those contributions to the world are instead being wasted flipping burgers or something worse than flipping burgers.\n\nbut in the arts, its the most profound, yes i truly believe...artist should be supported, not having to choose a lifetime of poverty just because they have to keep making art."

I had a couple of hundred bucks to work with and started up a computer repair company. It was at home, so I did free pick up and drop off of computers. Same day service. About a third of the price of Best Buy. And very professional, amongst other reasons why I felt I would do a better job.    \nSo I go out and hand out fliers for my business. Holy shit people were mad at me! Go door to door just to give a flier and a few words about the company and people would look at you and spit venom like you just told them their mother was a Siberian Husky. Went out to a Target to put fliers on cars. Had security called on me two minutes into it and escorted off the property. The only real success I had at getting customers was advertising on the radio, but it was a terrible deal for me. I got a couple of 15 second slots in exchange for $1200 worth of vouchers that they sell at half price on their show. I had a handful of customers from that, but all were free jobs.    \n    \nWhy am I mentioning this? Because people HATE a self-starter. People HATE a person trying to make it happen for themselves. People will gladly talk about supporting their local economy and how much they love the story of an underdog, but don't you dare expect them to help make that happen. But you also better not get any social services or safety nets. So many people are left in a hard spot because of this greedy, backward, hypocritical nature that so many people have."

But hear me out.\n\nIt's not enough.\n\nThe problem is **the people** who are in control of the companies, and how these companies are structured, to take advantage of the workers and the consumers to the sole profit of a handful of owners.\n\nWhen a technology delivers an increase in production, and suddenly 750 workers are needed instead of 1000, they get rid of the \"excess\" workers and pocket the profit.\n\nAnd that's fine, if all you care about is your own already obscene wealth.  It's ethically permissible, nobody's will is being violated by force or fraud.  But it wrecks society.  People are out of work, there are more people competing for the same jobs, decreasing the amount employers are willing to pay, less people spending money in the marketplace, ... but I'm preaching to the choir, you all know how bad this is.\n\nBasic income is a good idea.  It addresses the problem of people not being able to afford life.  But it doesn't address the root of the problem, the fact that the world will still be controlled by greedy misanthropic *REDACTED*.\n\nI propose we go after the root cause.  I propose that we take the power these people have away from them by destroying their enterprises and replacing them with ours.\n\nHow?  Organize the 99% into one gigantic worker-owned corporation.  Crush companies in the free market, one at a time.  We do all the work, we have all the knowledge, and together, we have the power.  Start with small companies, weak companies.  Grow.  Take their customers, take their employees.  Buy companies in the supply chains, then cut them off.  Wreck them.\n\nAt some point, when we achieve critical mass, we stop taking their dirty ill-gotten currency.  We are an economy unto ourselves, and their accumulated wealth dissolves because we won't honor it.  Money depends on belief.  We stop believing in theirs.\n\nAnd our enterprise is going to have all the problems that any human undertaking has.  We will have to deal with greed, with people who aspire to power, with cheats and malcontents.  But our system won't be designed from the ground up to encourage and reward those behaviors.  We won't be perfect, but at least we won't be perfectly foul, we'll be heading in the right direction.\n\nAs it is now, if you realize how cocked-up the world is, you know that any job you have, working for just about any company out there, you are intrinsically part of the problem.  I want an alternative.  I want to work for a company who's success means my success, and success for society in general.  I'm tired of working for my enemy.\n\nI propose we don't hope for change, don't ask for change.  I propose we make the change.  The \"elite\" are not our friends, they mean us harm.  Let's wreck them."

They frequently call strikes, and only call them off when management agrees to their demands.\n\nThere's also the fact that station staff are still employed, even though ticket sales are now entirely handled by self-service machines - though this is a current bone of contention between management and the unions.\n\nLondoners are always complaining about these strikes, and \"overpaid\" tube workers (among all the other things Londoners routinely complain about), but my response is always along the lines of \"If you joined a union, you could get paid that much and have that same job-security.\""

Capitalism is not the silver bullet, but it actually works. If anything, failures of today's capitalism stem from not being capitalist enough, they have their roots in lack of innovation and ingenuity.\n\nAsk yourself, in a situation where there is clearly so much work to be done so that everyone can prosper (because not everyone is prospering, obviously), what is preventing people from doing that work? Why is work that pushes commercials or junk food down people's throats rewarded, and work that feeds people and gives them free time not?\n\nI bet people would pay for things that would give them more free time... wouldn't they? There's your profit. Find those things, work on them, and people will pay you. It's a big, fat opportunity that everyone is missing.\n\nOf course things suck when everybody is working on producing shitty things nobody actually needs and not improving stuff. The smartest people on earth are what, working on yet another way to talk to your friends? Screw that, of course things are not improving. We should have solved a bunch of problems already, including world hunger and poverty. People don't need jobs. People need to figure out how to get what they need and get it, aggressively. If you think you need a job, then don't whine when you don't have money - you're getting exactly what you wanted, you wanted to work for somebody else and make him richer!

Improve vertical mobility in American society and prepare the American economy for widespread automation by implementing a modest basic income system, such as universal basic income, guaranteed minimum income, or a negative income tax. Ensure healthcare is affordable for all Americans by implementing a single payer healthcare system or by providing Americans with healthcare vouchers. Support Americans' freedoms by ending the costly and ineffective war on drugs and treating drug addiction as a health issue instead, as Portugal has done. Secure America's place as the world leader in science and technology by funding scientific research and investing in the development of new technologies, especially in fields like computing, robotics, and genetics. Bring jobs back to America and develop a progressive tax plan with bipartisan support by lowering corporate taxes and income taxes for lower and middle class Americans, replacing them with taxes on consumption, inheritance, carbon emissions, and upper class incomes. Fund infrastructure development and social programs by slashing our bloated military budget. Guarantee American workers a living wage by raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour, or by permanently tying the minimum wage to the rate of inflation.\"\n\n\nI tried to word it in a way that wouldn't sound too partisan and might be half-way viable under a Republican Congress.

We have a well-documented and established advocacy coalition who have won over influential politicians and apparently journalists. In the meantime, people like me, who see ourselves in many respects as liberal and caring, but realistic, stood down and watched this emerging disaster unfold. Anyone who has had a conversation with a few of those campers and parkers learn the truth; that the majority have little history in the region and came here based upon reputation that it was better for their situation than where they came from. Even in your own pages, profiles of individuals interviewed who tell their stories demonstrate the majority are not from here. People are not stupid, including homeless people. All of us respond to economic inducement and make rational choices based upon our options.\n\nThat's why a national Basic Income could help other struggling regions of the country have more opportunity.  It would be much cheaper to make it possible for people to remain in their home areas where life is more affordable, then to fuel the Ponzi scheme of increasing housing costs in major centres. Ignoring the problem just makes it worse."

Along the river about 600 of them created 115 tons of waste in just the last 3 weeks.  In that same time the city has collected and cleaned up over 4,000 used needles in the area.  The homeless advocates claim they're all insulin needles, if that lets you know what some people delude themselves into thinking.  There's also over 1,000 bikes, which I'm sure is just a ride share program with \"donated\" bikes.  At the same time there's been a massive spike in both car and home break ins around the area.\n\nDid I mention there's hundreds of empty beds available at local shelters that the homeless people refuse to even go to?\n\nMy point is that homelessness is about far more than just having a place to live."

Despite multiple charity groups attempting to provide housing he refuses. Local Police have given up attempting to relocate him as he has lawyered up previously and public defenders seem to find a loophole. In his case, he has never assaulted anyone.\n\nIn another area, a group of homeless formed a tent community under a bridge. Due to repeated assaults on people walking through the area, the homeless were forcible removed by Police.\n\nCases vary: as a general observation, a group of homeless will attract and/or enable theft/violence issues through the anonymity a group provides. Add the enabling of entrenched homeless by allowing a squatter type community to take root, it's a better solution to move homeless into shelters and away from squatter type environments."

Asking for a rent payment and paying it, is at the end of the day *bad*, and we should strive to *decrease* rents and gradually *decrease* our reliance on a system of rent payments.\n\nSo the right solution here would have been to spend that $100k to get them a home, perhaps to share among themselves.  Something like that.  Making some landlord rich should not be a part of helping anyone.  When you're helping someone, there is no reason why some specific private individual should receive unearned income, which is what rent is to a significant extent.\n\nWhen people pay rent, a portion of that payment is proper because there is maintenance of the property, for example, and it's reasonable to have to compensate for that.  But a portion of rent is improper, because it's a payment only for the status of someone being an \"owner\" and not for any work done.\n\nI am strongly against the government using aid money to pay rents to any landlords.\n\nThe only exception to this I see is the idea that we're all co-owners of this Earth, and so if any rent is to be paid properly, it has to be paid to everyone equally as equal co-owners.  I am against private individuals collecting rent in a completely private manner."

People managing Seattle's money are just doing their 9-5 jobs and I bet that if they could help those homeless people, they would - they are just guided by law and policies that are the root of this cold approach to homelessness."

A permanent basic income is in part compensation for that history, and for the mere fact that one group owns all the island's land resources and doesn't want to share with everyone. \n\nBeing an Island is also an advantage for logistics. If Indiana had one, people from say, Chicago, could move to Indiana to get their basic income but commute to their same job in Chicago. It'd be rather hard to do that in Hawaii."

The victims, it appears, were drawn in by wild promises about equitable access to wealth, education, and home ownership, but before they knew it, they got played for suckers.\u201d Winthrop added that they haven\u2019t identified the scheme\u2019s kingpin, but are investigating a number of upper-middle class white men who have suspiciously benefitted from the longtime scam.

Jobs (which is to say, natural resources) are the bottleneck. Millennials are better educated that any prior generation in history; they're *ridiculously* well educated, with rates of university graduation that would have been considered science fiction just 40 years ago. But that also means they're competing for jobs with people who are *also* ridiculously well educated. Instead of pushing wages up (as was promised), all this does is push employment standards up while real wages stagnate or fall."

Moreover, the MECSA backdates  benefits to March (adding over a trillion to the cost) and excludes (or phases out, probably) benefits for individuals making over $120,000.  It applies to \"every U.S. resident,\" which apparently includes non-citizens/non-permanent residents.\n\n\\- Backdating seems extraneous.  Sure, it's nice.  But front-loading the benefit with $1 to $2 trillion in immediate costs seems overly ambitious.\n\n\\- Putting an arbitrary income maximum hurts support for the bill.  Sure, it only excludes around 5% of the total population of America (perhaps 4%).  But it adds a whole lot of confusion and will inevitably slow and complicate any payments made to people.  Questions like \"What counts as income,\" \"Is it income for this year or last,\" \"Will children still receive payments if income exceeds maximums,\" and others remain unresolved.  All to save, at most, 5% of the total cost.  High earners will definitely pay much more in taxes if a UBI passes.  So don't worry about it now.\n\n\\- You'll find significant resistance to giving the full benefit - which is $10,000 a month - to all \"U.S. residents.\"  Even after accounting for long-term undocumented immigrants, there would still be decisions to make about international students, people on work visas, etc., etc.  This provision probably adds more in total costs to the bill than the income limits, all while adding another component of political opposition.\n\nFinally, I have yet to hear a politician directly address how this benefit would impact eligibility for various federal and state programs, including Medicaid.  At $2,000 per household member, every single resident household in America would be fully excluded from any Medicaid benefits.  It's an important uncertainty to address."

In the next 20-30 years we will have robots taking more jobs than seems feasible at the moment.^1 (Hopefully we won't have to get this deep into unemployment rates, but) When we get closer to 30%-40% unemployment rate we will have to move away from a monetary based society.^2 How exciting is it to be part of the foundation for a global society?!?! What happens when people don't go into depression because they're not sure how they will pay their bills? Now I haven't read all the books about what others think about what would happen, I've only done my own polls of co-workers and friends on what they would do if they didn't have to worry about money. I think we need people to just realized that we CAN live without money.\n\n\n1. Yes, they may not be the \"food replicators\" like on Star Trek, but how many jobs could be removed if Robots replaced \"just\" the fast food workers. \n2. This topic is something I've personally been thinking about for the past month or two. Thinking of the jobs that are solely based on money (i.e. stock market and insurance) and what the world would look like without these and other jobs.^3 When people are more focused on helping others and the betterment of society as a whole (as is stated by the meme).  \n3. And not just jobs, but religions as well. (i.e. tithing)"

Theres a wikipedia on the the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Tense_%28Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine%29) but below is a bit of the plot:\n\n&gt; When Commander Sisko, Dr. Bashir, and Jadzia Dax attempt to beam down to Earth from the Defiant, an accident occurs and they materialize in San Francisco in the year 2024.\nDax is separated from her crewmates. Offered help by a prominent businessman, Chris Brynner, she manages to get an ID, money, and a place to live.\nMeanwhile, Sisko and Bashir are awakened by a pair of police officers, who believe them to be vagrants and warn them to get off the streets. They are escorted to a \"Sanctuary District\", a fenced-off ghetto that is used to contain the poor, the sick, the mentally disabled, and anyone else who cannot support themselves. Sisko sees the date on the calendar and realizes they have arrived just days before the \"Bell Riots\", a violent confrontation in the San Francisco Sanctuary District, that Sisko recalls as a watershed moment in human history. Dozens will be killed, including a man named Gabriel Bell, the leader of the demonstration. Bell will become a hero because of his self-sacrifice while protecting hostages. As a result of Bell's heroism, attitudes to the poor and sick begin to change. Unable to find a building to sleep in, Sisko and Bashir live in the street.\n\n"

Interesting stuff.\n\nhttps://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/08/29/poor-concentration-poverty-reduces-brainpower-needed-navigating-other-areas-life\n\n&gt;In a series of experiments, the researchers found that pressing financial concerns had an immediate impact on the ability of low-income individuals to perform on common cognitive and logic tests. On average, a person preoccupied with money problems exhibited a drop in cognitive function similar to a 13-point dip in IQ, or the loss of an entire night\u2019s sleep.\n\n&gt;But when their concerns were benign, low-income individuals performed competently, at a similar level to people who were well off, said corresponding author Jiaying Zhao, who conducted the study as a doctoral student in the lab of co-author Eldar Shafir, Princeton\u2019s William Stewart Tod Professor of Psychology and Public Affairs. Zhao and Shafir worked with Anandi Mani, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick in Britain, and Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard University economics professor.\n\n&gt;\u201cThese pressures create a salient concern in the mind and draw mental resources to the problem itself. That means we are unable to focus on other things in life that need our attention,\u201d said Zhao, who is now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia.\n\n&gt;\u201cPrevious views of poverty have blamed poverty on personal failings, or an environment that is not conducive to success,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re arguing that the lack of financial resources itself can lead to impaired cognitive function. The very condition of not having enough can actually be a cause of poverty.\u201d"

So of course business gets better and hiring increases, especially among chain restaurants frequented by the poor and the middle class (hello, micky D!). \n\nThis runs directly AGAINST the views of advocates of austerity, which is the sort of people who come up with studies saying that raising minimum wages will hurt an economy. THESE would be the people who would have to SCRAMBLE to find an explanation. It's very simple if you look at it without ideological blinkers on."

Total sale dollars are up. That being a product of price increases.

Seattle unemployment has dropped from 3.9% to 3.0% whereas Portland dropped from 5.1% to 3.1%.  As you can see, the minimum wage change in Seattle appears to have had an impact on employment as the Seattle drop wasn't has dramatic as in Portland.  Also, it takes time for fundamental shifts to occur in employment markets and businesses won't change their employment strategy overnight especially when the full impact of $15 won't show up until 2021.

Can those policies also encourage work, relieve financial and time poverty, and reduce economic marginalization? Can a basic income reduce cost pressures in other areas of government spending, such as healthcare? Can a basic income strengthen the incentive to work, by responsibly helping those who are working but still living below the poverty line?\n\n&gt; A guaranteed income would provide a floor no one would fall beneath and citizens would receive it regardless of employment status.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5uzl2n/what_happens_when_you_give_basic_income_to_the/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~67605 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **income**^#1 **poverty**^#2 **basic**^#3 **work**^#4 **provide**^#5"

But just because a job takes a high amount of effort, or even skill, to perform, it doesn't mean it has any meaning or adds value to  the company (or that the company adds value to society).  \nYour hard work could be a net negative in your company if it's not set up properly. You could be working at undoing someone's hard work, or someone else could be working hard at undoing your work, or you could both be working hard at something that some management layer above you voids at the end of the cycle.  \nBut why would a company even pay money for your  labour if it doesn't contribute anything? Two reasons. A, your labour is cheap, labour supply outweighs the labour demand, yes, even top salaries are cheap and B, you're being paid because the company doesn't have a good method of evaluating the efficiency of their workers. The group combined clearly is delivering value, which means that some genius employees within the pool might be saving everyone else, but the company just keeps paying out everyone because they don't want to risk cutting out the hidden genius.  \n\nSo here we are, most of us in a treadmill. Barely recognizing the  context in which we work, waiting for the day a program turns us obsolete while convincing ourselves we're hard working responsible adults trading our time for cash.  "

Why could i not get paid this to help disabled children learn to walk? I'm sure i am more stressed and anxious than i have been in any previous role, despite the fact that it barely qualifies as a 'high stress job'.\n\nA system that would push people who want to do good into more and more frivolous roles helping coorporations save a few pennies on sick pay really needs a complete overhaul IMO.

I suppose tightening down the choices of how variables are dealt with could remove purpose and self-determination from work.  Now, is my job one that could be erased from the earth and no one would notice?  All my Fortune 500 company would have to do is spend more money on a piece of software, and 80% of my job would go away.  There are days when I think that my company could go away and no one would notice.  All it would take is a few shifts in policy regarding security, and 40% of our reason for existing would disappear.  A simple shift in public policy on Science and Technology, and another 30% would be gone, and if people would just eat right, our medical division would have no job to do.  With a shift in thinking here, and little shift in policy there, ALL work except growing food, making clothes, and building shelter, becomes pointless.

They generally use it to try to get even more\n\nI have been saying this for years. If someone is wealthy beyond measure then usually the only thing for them to use their money for is to get more money. As a result, the rich do get richer, if only because they are the only ones who can afford to.\n\n&gt; This means that \u2018trickle down\u2019 arguments are wrong. Yes, the rich employ a few servants and provide demand for accountants, tax advisors and luxury services, but far fewer jobs result from this than would be case if their income were redistributed back to ordinary people with a much higher propensity to consume.\n\nThis as well. We can't all be servants to the wealthy, even if they could afford it they simply don't need every one of us. A servant's job is to either enhance a wealthy person's life, or get them more money, and beyond that there would be no incentive for a wealthy person to hire someone.\n\nAnd on the nature of jobs, jobs are not created by mystical \"job-creators\", they are created by demand. The wealthy may have demand for servants, but there aren't enough of them to make it a stable job market. If more people had even a little expendable money then jobs catering to luxuries would boom, where as if every non-wealthy individual earned a peasant's wages demand would stagnate at one's life needs."
