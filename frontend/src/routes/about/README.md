## Product Pitch
Product good so money please?

## What is UBI?
Universal basic income is a form of social welfare, people receive supplementary income from the state. 
- Full basic income, if it provides above the poverty line.
- Partial basic income, any amount below the poverty line.

No country has implemented either for their full population, however there have been pilot projects all over, including in [Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot)

Some countries have a child benefit that is similar to UBI as it is a buffer income for people taking care of children.

### Automation
There is an ongoing automation revolution leading to menial jobs being eliminated. Like cashiers in virtually every big box store. People are losing their jobs and the minimum wage is not being increased in relation to increases in productivity, at least in North America. Should the state protect workers pushed out of their industry by offering a supplemental wage? For example, truck drivers in the future with self driving trucks.

### Living wage
A living wage is the hourly wage a worker needs to earn to cover their basic expenses and participate in their community. This is not the same as the minimum wage. How do organizations determine the living wage for an area?

Personally what I consider a living wage is having enough money to have your physiological needs met, as seen in Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs.

UBI could serve as the gap closer between minimum wage and living wage.

### Why talk about this?
We need to understand our topic so that we know what kind of data we can pull from the internet about it. Our job isn't to solve this issue or to give our opinions on it. We need to focus on delivering objective data about the topic in a clear and concise manner.

## Visualization

### Idea 1: Random Post.
Display a random post from our database, along with information about where and when it came from.

### Idea 2: Sentiment analysis.
See if we can determine overall political sentiment towards the issue. We are analyzing the sentiment of the random post. We plan to implement overall database sentiment across all posts.

### Idea 3: Histogram -> TO:DO Interactive word cloud. 
A world cloud showcases which words are most related to the central topic. A histogram is just a different visualization of the same idea.
Clicking on a word in the word cloud will take you to its definition in google. Could possibly integrate chat gpt definitions or answer to questionss somehow through their API.
